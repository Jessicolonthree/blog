&lt;p>Persona 5 is a JRPG that came out in Japan in 2016 and then the rest of the world in 2017 on the PS3 and PS4. In 2019, a more complete edition of the game was released called Persona 5 Royal, which has loads of extra playtime, a whole extra character and semester (basically what we call a term), more personas, more places to enhance your party&amp;rsquo;s stats and even the ability to upgrade the Baton Pass. This is the version I played on PS5. In fact, the Steam, Series S/X and PS5 versions of the game are the only ones that run at 60fps, both Royals and Original ran at 30 on every platform (except Steam of course)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
