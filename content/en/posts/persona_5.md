## Part 0: Introduction
Persona 5 was a RPG that came out in Japan in 2016 and then the rest of the world in 2017 on the PS3 and PS4. In 2019, a more complete edition of the game was released called Persona 5 Royal, which has loads of extra playtime, a whole extra character and semester (basically what we call a term), more personas, more places to enhance your party's stats and even the ability to upgrade the Baton Pass. This is the version I played on PS5. In fact, the Steam, Series S/X and PS5 versions of the game are the only ones that run at 60fps, both Royals and Original ran at 30 on every platform (except Steam of course)

## Part I: Combat
Persona 5 Royal has to be one of, if not the best implementation of turn-based combat i've ever had the pleasure of playing. I've played a few with it before such as the Pokemon and Fire Emblem games, but I'd say Persona's is the best. You've got the typical things like weaknesses, crits, multiple types of multiple moves and party management, but Persona adds a ton to it which I absolutely love. You've got the *insanely* stylish menus, a massive variety of Personas to manage and battle with, each with their own types, moves, abilities, and loads of stats to consider. You've then got up to 3 other people to command too, each with their own load of stats as well as their own Persona and as much as it sounds, the game makes it feel easy while still allowing for some very complex combos.
