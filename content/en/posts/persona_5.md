## Part I: Combat
Persona 5 has to be one of, if not the best implementation of turn-based combat i've ever had the pleasure of playing. I've played a few with it before such as the Pokemon and Fire Emblem games, but I'd say Persona's is the best. You've got the typical things like weaknesses, crits, multiple types of multiple moves and party management, but Persona adds a ton to it which I absolutely love. You've got the *insanely* stylish menus, a massive variety of Personas to manage and battle with, each with their own types, moves, abilities, and loads of stats to consider. You've then got up to 3 other people to command too, each with their own load of stats as well as their own Persona and as much as it sounds, the game makes it feel easy while still allowing for some very complex combos.
